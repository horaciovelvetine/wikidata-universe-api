			"body": "This app, Wikiverse, is built to explore Wikipedia data in a 3D world – the one you create. This tutorial puts you inside of your Wikipedia topic and gives you the freedom to move around and explore. Start by searching for any topic just like you would on Wikipedia. Wikiverse finds it and draws it in front of you, but that’s just the start. Wikiverse finds all the things it knows related to your topic, and with just a click, you can explore related ideas, things, people, and places, a never-ending rabbit hole generator. The cube drawn below represents ‘The Moon’, and it’s the first topic you’re going to explore in this short guided tutorial.",

			"body": "This cube is called a topic in the Wikiverse, by clicking on it you display its name: ‘Moon’ and a short description on the lower left of your screen. Since all of the Wikiverse’s data is from Wikipedia’s source database (Wikidata), clicking on the title in the bottom left will take you to the original source page. Wikidata contains information about over 100 million different topics, and in the Wikiverse these cubes could represent any one of them.",

Let’s look around and get a feel for just what ‘3D space’ means. Use your mouse to do a bit of exploring: when you left-click on a cube your screen will focus on it, but if you left-click and drag your mouse you can move yourself all around whatever you select.",

As you explore (i.e. click on topics) you add new cubes to your own 3D world, constructing a constellation of cubes floating in 3D space. Using your scroll wheel (mouse highly suggested!) you can zoom in and out on your world and get a new perspective on the topic you’re exploring. Take some time to get the hang of zooming and exploring using your mouse.",

			"title": "connecting the dots",
			"body": "When you search for something the Wikivers places the result in front of you. In the background, however, it continues the search by fetching any related topics and drawing them on screen around your original topic. To describe these relationships the Wikiverse uses the humble ‘statement’ which follows a simple convention: e.g. ‘Kevin Bacon is an actor’. Statements always consist of a source: ‘Kevin Bacon’, a property: ‘occupation of’, and a target: ‘actor’. This paradigm provides a meaningful way to describe relationships and is the foundational concept underpinning how vertices are connected in the Wikiverse.",

The Kevin Bacon cube is still positioned in the middle, find it and click to explore all the relationships the Wikiverse found. Each new cube hovering around ‘Kevin Bacon’ is a related topic Wikipedia knows about, just waiting to be discovered. By adding the related topics a few new things have also been drawn on the screen. In the bottom right is all of the related topics the Wikiverse found as a convenient list of statements, and the cube on screen has a series of colored lines connecting it to it’s related topics. More on this to follow.",

			"body": "Each time you select (or hover) over a topic, the Wikiverse will display all the statements which connect to and from that topic. These statements are drawn on screen as lines which connect the cubes in 3D space. As these lines pull related vertices towards one another, any unrelated vertices are in turn pushed away, this process positions them in 3D space and forms the web of topics drawn around you to explore. To learn a bit more let’s simplify things and focus on the original example ‘Kevin Bacon is an actor",

While exploring the previous full results, and now in this simplified example you’ll see that statements (the lines) are represented in 3 colors. Each color represents the direction that the statement flows based on the currently selected topic. In this example starting at the source ‘Kevin Bacon’, through the property of ‘occupation of’, and ending at the target ‘actor’/ The line is red when that statement flows out of the of the topic, colored blue when the statement flow in, and purple when 2 matching statements connect a single pair of topics.",

			"body": "After selecting ‘actor’, you’ll notice that the color of line connecting Kevin Bacon and actor has changed color to blue. This is because statements have a natural direction, and this direction is determined using whatever topic is currently selected. While Kevin Bacon may be an actor (red line), not all actors are ‘Kevin Bacon’, and so the line changes to blue. In the bottom right of your screen these relationships are listed as individual statements where: their source (currently selected) topic is pictured as the yellow cube, the property is highlighted in the directional color, arrows indicate this statements direction, and finally the title of the target topic. Clicking inside this display on either icon will move your focus to that position in the Wikiverse, and clicking the property will take you to the Wikidata source page to learn more about how this pair of vertices’ connection is described (the property).",

Searching this way is meant to encourage and foster topic discovery, and is central to the Wikiverse itself, leaving just one thing to understand about exploring: adding topics. Each time you click on a new topic (cube) related topics are found and added to your current search, placed according to their own statements possibly even connecting them back to existing topics in your search.",

Hovering your mouse over any cube will display its details in the upper left corner of your screen. As soon as you click on that cube, however, the Wikiverse will add related topics to your search’s wider contextual universe, expanding topics for you to explore and building a broader constellation.",

Graph details can be toggled on/off to show the number of vertices and statements currently on screen, as well as where you're currently looking in 3D space (Camera position and focus). The Axis Orientation and Bounding Box draw some helpful indicators on screen to help keep you oriented in your search. The final settings are experimental features which re-run the layout process, changing the position of all the vertices in the current search. Suggestions welcome if these are helpful!",
